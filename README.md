# solidity-school
This is an initiative for the early solidity developers by those who were early developers sometime.

In this approach, we are looking to categorize the smart contract according to the difficulty level in multiple standards. For now, we are
keeping the standard 0 to 5.

This initiative needs great support from Blockchain enthusiast, developer and researchers to build this school in away which can 
attract learners and provide them ease for development.

## Categorization
Categorization of contracts in standard can be discussed via issues/PRs. 

Initially, contibutor will suggest the standard and it can further be discussed in the thread.
