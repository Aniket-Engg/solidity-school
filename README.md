# :school_satchel: solidity-school
Solidity School is an initiative to prepare a code base for the solidity beginners by those who were beginners sometime.It categorize the smart contracts according to different difficulty levels and in multiple standards. For now, standards are 0 to 5(can be discussed). 

Idea of Solidity School is to **Learn-n-Contribute**. So a beginner will learn to code and will contribute for the upcoming ones. 

So, in this repo, one needs to start with standard 0 (std-0). Each standard will have a problem statement and an informational hint for each task, learners can try to write the contract by solving the problem statement and understanding the hint. Once done, final contract can be compared with the one provided in this repository. If learner thinks that his or her contract is better than the one in this repo, a Pull Request can be raised to contribute

This project needs a great support from Blockchain enthusiasts, developer and researchers to build this school in a way which can attract learners and provide them ease for learning the development.

## Categorization
Categorization of contracts in standard will be done in the way so that one can increase the learning with movement to upwards. In case of any discrepancies, it can be discussed via issues/PRs. 

Initially, contributor will suggest the standard and it can further be discussed in the thread.
