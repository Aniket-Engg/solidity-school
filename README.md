# :school_satchel: solidity-school
Solidity School is an initiative to prepare a code base for the solidity beginners by those who were beginners sometime. It categorize the smart contracts in multiple standards according to different difficulty levels. For now, standards are 0 to 5.

Idea of Solidity School is to **Learn-n-Contribute**. So a beginner will learn to code and can contribute too while learning.

:point_right: Solidity school is listed on [useWeb3 platform](https://www.useweb3.xyz/courses/solidity-school) and mostly finds a place in top 5
**Most popular last week** resources 

## How to start
To start learning, one needs to start with standard 0 (std-0). Each standard will have a problem statement and an informational hint for each task. Learners can try to write the contract to solve the problem statement by using the given hint. 

Once done, final contract can be compared with the one provided in this repository. If learner thinks that his or her contract is better than the one in the repo, a Pull Request can be raised to contribute.

This project needs a great support from Blockchain enthusiasts, developer and researchers to build this school in a way which can attract learners and provide them ease for learning the development.

## Categorization
Categorization of contracts in standard is done to increase the understanding. 

In case of any discrepancies, discussion can be done via issues/PRs.
