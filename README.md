# :school_satchel: solidity-school
This is an initiative for the early solidity developers by those who were early developers sometime.

In this approach, we are looking to categorize the smart contract according to the difficulty level in multiple standards. For now, we are keeping the standard 0 to 5(can be discussed).

This initiative needs great support from Blockchain enthusiast, developer and researchers to build this school in a way which can attract learners and provide them ease for development.

## Categorization
Categorization of contracts in standard will be done in the way so that one can increase the learning with movement to upwards. In case of any discrepancies, it can be discussed via issues/PRs. 

Initially, contributor will suggest the standard and it can further be discussed in the thread.

## More Details

## Solidity Version
Currently we are going with Solidity version 0.6.0. We will update the contract by following major & minor release.
