# SafeCalculator
## Problem Statement

Extend `std-1/1_Calculator/Calculator.sol` with `UINT` type by performing below checks in its methods:

* Value Overflow
* Value Underflow
* Invalid Operation

Use `require` or `assert`.

## Informational Hint

### Error Handling

* `assert(bool condition)`: causes an invalid opcode and thus state change reversion if the condition is not met - to be used for internal errors.
* `require(bool condition)`: reverts if the condition is not met - to be used for errors in inputs or external components.
* `require(bool condition, string memory message)`: reverts if the condition is not met - to be used for errors in inputs or external components. Also provides an error message.
* `revert()`: abort execution and revert state changes
* `revert(string memory reason)`:abort execution and revert state changes, providing an explanatory string
