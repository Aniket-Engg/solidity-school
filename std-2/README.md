# Standard :two:
Welcome to Standard-2 of solidity-school !!!

Hope you had a great time with previous one and become confident to move forward. Looks you are quite eager to get your hands on more big things. 

In this Standard, you are going to learn about events, fallback, require, assert, mapping, enum, struct, modifier and many more new things.

Getting impatient, Let's go for it! :running:

:point_right: **NOTE:** If you have come here directly jumping the Standards 0 & 1 and don't have tried writing even a single smart contract, we request you to start from the beginning and spend some time in [std-0](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-0) & [std-1](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-1).
