# EvenOdd
## Problem Statement

Write a contract 'EvenOdd' to which implements a function named check.

`check()` accepts a number and return whether the passed number is odd or even without consuming gas. (Ignore various checks on passed parameters for now)

## Informational Hint

Any integer that can be divided exactly (i.e. remainder = 0) by 2 is an even number.

* Modulo: The modulo operation `a % n` yields the remainder `r` after the division of the operand `a` by the operand `n`.
