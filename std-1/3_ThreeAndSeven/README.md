# ThreeAndSeven
## Problem Statement

Write a contract 'ThreeAndSeven' which implements a function named check.

`check()` accepts a number and return true if number is fully divided by 3 or 7 and greater than 10 else false. This function should not consume any gas.

## Informational Hint

### Boolean Value Type
`bool`: The possible values are constants true and false.

**Operators:**

* ! (logical negation)
* && (logical conjunction, “and”)
* || (logical disjunction, “or”)
* == (equality)
* != (inequality)

The operators `||` and `&&` apply the common short-circuiting rules. This means that in the expression `f(x) || g(y)`, if `f(x)` evaluates to true, `g(y)` will not be evaluated even if it may have side-effects.
