# Standard :one:
Looks you have passed through the Standard 0 and have a basic level of understanding of smart contract development and related concepts. 

Here we will go further on Solidity ladder and will get you introduced to one level up things.

Here you will be introduced to various operators, conditional statements, data types & SPDX License Identifier etc.

Let's move!

:point_right: **NOTE:** If you have come here directly jumping Standard 0 and don't have tried writing even a single smart contract, we request you to start from the beginning and spend some time in [std-0](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-0).
