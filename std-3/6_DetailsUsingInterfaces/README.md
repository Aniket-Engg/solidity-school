# DetailsUsingInterface
## Problem Statement

Write a contract named `DetailsUsingInterface` to get details of a human being like name, age and bloodgroup. 

It should use multiple interfaces and a final interface inheriting them all.

## Informational Hint

### Interfaces Inheritance

Contracts can inherit interfaces as they would inherit other contracts.

Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces. This has the same rules as normal inheritance.
