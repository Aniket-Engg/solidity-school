# AttendanceRegisterExtended
## Problem Statement

In this problem we will use Inheritance. 

Inherit the [AttendanceRegister contract in std-2](../../std-2/5_AttendanceRegister/AttendanceRegister.sol) and create a new contract with name `AttendanceRegisterExtended`. This new contract should have a method to get the details of Student using rollnumber.

## Informational Hint

### Inheritance

Solidity supports multiple inheritance including polymorphism.

It is possible to call functions further up in the inheritance hierarchy internally by explicitly specifying the contract using `ContractName.functionName()`
