# Standard :three:
Hope you are having a great time in this school and getting known to various concepts with examples. 

Now this is time to get level high & play with more than one.

In this Standard, you will learn about libraries, interfaces, abstract contracts, inheritance, interaction with deployed contract and other related things.

Get ready for this! :sunglasses:

:point_right: **NOTE:** If you have come here directly jumping the Standards 0, 1 & 2 and don't have tried writing even a single smart contract, we request you to start from the beginning and spend some time in [std-0](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-0), [std-1](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-1) & [std-2](https://github.com/Aniket-Engg/solidity-school/tree/master/std-2).
